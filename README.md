# MyForm 

## Motivation

The goal of this project is for me to return in the .NET world by doing a small project from A to Z. 

- I'm using [Rider IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) (from jetbrains).
- I'm on a Mac (M1)

The application will start simple but evolve with the time and PR. 

I want to practice and learn

- .NET ASPIRE
- Angular


## App Idea

### Phase 1

- Create an API in .NET and a frontend in Angular. 
- Connect all of this with ASPIRE .NET
- Very small form with a call to the API to save in a database (probably postgres)

### Phase 2

- Deploy on Azure


### Phase 3

- Add a simple form and send data to an API
- Show the data from that form on another page

### Phase 4
... to come
