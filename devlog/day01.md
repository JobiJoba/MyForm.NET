# Day 01

- Installed Rider on my mac
- Created Api project then added Aspire project (I had to install templates etc in between)
- Many issues because I created my Api project with .NET 9 and Aspire was on .NET 10. 
    - I would have thougth that you could have that but apparently not. 
- Added the Angular project and link it with .NET aspire so it's launched at the same times and I can see the container in the dashboard.
  - Port for Angular is managed with .NET Aspire - I followed this doc to make it works (a lot of obscure stuff to do https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/build-aspire-apps-with-nodejs )
  - As .NET Aspire seems to move fast a lot of article are written with deprecated information or old way to do things.
