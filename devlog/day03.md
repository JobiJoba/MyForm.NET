# Day 03

- Launched Aspire project and greeted with a "A new version of Aspire is available, upgrade"
  - The link to the upgrade procedure goes to the major upgrade, I was already on that major and it was just a minor version
  - So I just updated the Nuget packages.
- Added Angular Material, I hate that library but it seems to be the most famous one
- Change launchsettings to not open a browser every time I launch my container
- Improve the simpleForms by adding a way to submit forms entry (firstname-lastname)
- Refactor the typescript types to be PascalCase
- Added alias for types in Typescript
